# Electron-Fundamentals
Completed Exercises from PluralSight Electron Fundamentals by Jake Trent

**Project**
I followed the tutorials given on the PluralSight course by Jake Trent. I updated the electron version which came with making some updates
to the code.

In particular in the screenshot demo some of the functionality had to be moved to the main process rather than the renderer process.
There are also approaches using preload that can return the screen / desktopCapturer functionality to the renderer process with the correct configuration.
